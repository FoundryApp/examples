# Foundry: Example projects

Here is an example project where we create simple backend for managing users and their workspaces. In each directory we showcase a specific part of the Foundry functionality.

In each directory the `foundry.yaml` file describes how should the development environment look like before each evaluation run and which functions should be evaluated. (what is evaluation run?) (That could include what users, docs....should be created before each run and what functions should be evaluated?)
